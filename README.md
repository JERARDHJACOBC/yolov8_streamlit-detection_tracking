# yolov8_streamlit-detection_tracking
This repository is a comprehensive open-source project that demonstrates the integration of object detection and tracking using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and Streamlit, a popular Python web application framework for building interactive web applications. This project provides a user-friendly and customizable interface that can detect and track objects in real-time video streams.
# Requirements
Python 3.6+ YOLOv8 Streamlit
pip install ultralytics streamlit pytube
# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/CodingMantras/yolov8-streamlit-detection-tracking.git
Change to the repository directory: cd yolov8-streamlit-detection-tracking
Create weights, videos, and images directories inside the project.
Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights from (https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt) and save them to the weights directory in the same project.

Run the app with the following command: streamlit run app.py
The app should open in a new browser window.
